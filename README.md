# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms

CPU Scheduling Algorithms are methods employed by operating systems to manage the execution order of processes in a computer system. These algorithms determine which process gets access to the CPU at a given time, aiming to optimize resource utilization and system performance.

In this repo, we will implement three CPU scheduling algorithms:
1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
3. Banker's Algorithm

These algorithms have been implemented using C++. They govern the order and allocation of processes, impacting system efficiency. Our exploration aims to unveil the practical application of these algorithms, emphasizing their execution using the C++ programming language. The report aims to shed light on how these algorithms contribute to effective resource management in computer systems.
